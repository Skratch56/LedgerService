## Building the JARs

From the project root, run:
This will build the JARs for both services under:

```bash
  mvn clean install 
```

This will generate the executable jar file ledger-service/target/ledger-service-<version>.jar

from there you run 

```bash
  docker network create payments-net
```
The above will create the network to allow for the two services to communicate

```bash
  docker-compose up --build 
```

This will start:

Postgres on port 5432

Ledger Service on port 8081

Then you will be able to access the api docs on http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html
